#### HOW TO INSTALL:
If your server is on, stop it using the /stop command or stop command from the console, then put the downloaded GetSpawners.jar file inside your plugins folder then start your server again. To check installed plugins you can use the /plugins command.

&nbsp;
#### PERMISSIONS:
`To be able to mine spawners, you'll need at least:`
```
- getspawners.drop
- getspawners.drop.all
- getspawners.drop.100% or - getspawners.drop.<percentage>%
```

You'll need a permission plugin that allows you to set groups perms, individual perms, default perms, etc; we strongly recommend [LuckPerms](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/luckperms.28140/) as your permission plugin.
